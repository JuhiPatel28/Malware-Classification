## Description
Cyber attack attribution is the process of attempting to trace back a piece of code or malware to a perpetrator of a cyberattack. As cyber attacks have become more prevalent, cyber attack attribution is becoming more valuable. The process of cyber attack attribution can be done using reverse engineering. From the metadata of the malware executable file, we can gather data such as date of creation, variable names used, and what library calls are imported. This information can be used as features for attribution analysis. We need to extract the features from malware that can be used for attribution and analyse them using some technique to attribute the attacks.
