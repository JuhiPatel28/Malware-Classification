## Description
Cyber attack attribution is the process of attempting to trace back a piece of code or malware to a perpetrator of a cyberattack. As cyber attacks have become more prevalent, cyber attack attribution is becoming more valuable. The process of cyber attack attribution can be done using reverse engineering. From the metadata of the malware executable file, we can gather data such as date of creation, variable names used, and what library calls are imported. This information can be used as features for attribution analysis. We need to extract the features from malware that can be used for attribution and analyse them using some technique to attribute the attacks. 

## Data Classification, Extraction, and Use
Since we are doing static analysis, we needed to consider whether the malwares were packed or not. Packing is a form of code obfuscation that modifies the format of the malware by compressing or encrypting the data, so we would not be able to extract the artifacts we need without putting the malware through some type of unpacking software. Because of this, we used a tool called PEiD that can detect whether or not a malware sample is packed and classified all of our malware into either unpacked or packed categories. The number of packed and unpacked malwares per APT group are summarized in the table below. We have only used unpacked malware samples for attribution to APT Group.

We have extracted the following attributes from the VirusTotal reports for each malware sample
- pe-resource-langs
- imports
- pe-entry-points

We created a python script that would extract the above attributes from each of the json malware report files and consolidate it into one csv file. We created a CSV file with the mentioned three attributes, resource (i.e hash of the malware) and APT group columns which we fetched from the GitHub repository. Below is a snapshot of the unprocessed dataset.
